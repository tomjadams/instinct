Other ideas are available on [FeatureIdeas].
Current development tasks are available on [DevelopmentTasks].

== Release 0.1.7 ==

  * Core Features
    * ~~Marking of double fields based on naming convention.~~
    * Auto-create arrays of test doubles.
    * Improved stub creation
      * Interfaces, recursive constructor arguments.
      * Stub creation for classes containing non-constructor initialised methods (these may produce NPEs).
    * Specification groups.
    * Allow embedded contexts.
    * Automatic creation of specifications actors for inherited and nested contexts.
    * Automatic creation of subjects.
    * Naming conventions (Default prefi & Impl suffix) for automatic subject creation.
    * Move timing code from CommandLineRunner into BriefResultsFormatter.
  * Expectation API
    * ~~Add isEmpty() and isNotEmpty() to iterable checker.~~
    * Improve behaviour expectation syntax (see sandbox).
    * Exception checking - See Boost's assertThrows, inc.
    * Trait checking - Serializable, rejects null - expect.that(Foo.class).isSerializable(), expect.that(Foo.class).rejectsNullsInPublicMethods()
  * Maven integration
    * Initial Maven artefacts available on main repo.
  * JUnit integration
    * Add watchdog around forked VM.
    * Clean up termination and detection of failures using the failure property.
    * Confirm JUnit runner behaviour in Eclipse (Ctrl-Shift-F10 equivalent).
    * ~~Shipping with `junit-dep-4.4.jar` to avoid bundled Hamcrest.~~
  * Misc
    * Checkstyle errors on Windows.
    * [http://code.google.com/p/instinct/issues/detail?id=24 defect-24]
  * Bugs
    * ~~(defect-33) CollectionChecker.hasTheSameContentAs() is broken~~

== Release 0.1.8 ==

  * Expectation API
    * Custom extension to expectation API (via interface composer).
  * JUnit Integration
    * JUnit XML test output formatters, for integration of JUnit style XSL stylesheets.
    * TestDox output formatter, see JDave for details.
    * RSpec HTML output format.

== Release 0.2.0 ==

  * Documentation
    * Document lifecycle - how to extend, how to get callbacks for special behaviour.
  * Build
    * Add simian
    * Self host all current tests.
    * Test coverage to 100%
    * Fail release build if any fixes left for that release.
  * Infrastructure
    * Rationalise JAR packaging (single, multiple?).

== Release 0.2.1 ==

  * IntelliJ Plugin
    * Inspections/intentions
      * Add generators for contexts & lifecycle methods.
      * Lookup based on subject annotation/naming convention.
      * Add intention/inspection for areas where the expectations could be improved. eg. expect.that(container.size()).equalTo(3) => expect.that(container).isOfSize(3)
      * Hook into "Create field ..." intention to annotate fields as dummies, mocks, etc.
      * Allow loosening/tightening of mock constraints, one(foo).bar(bar) => one(foo).bar(with(eq(bar))), tab between constraints (with list of eq(), same(), etc. Also work on returnValue, throwsException, etc.
    * Runer
      * Fix current intermittent errors when running specs.  
      * Hook into JUnit runner for GUI.
    * Release on IDEA plugins site.
    * Add a view of pending specifications
 
= Previous Releases =

== Release 0.1.6 ==

  * Core Features
    * ~~Remove the need for @Context annotation.~~
    * ~~Automatic creation of specification doubles: mocks, stubs and dummies~~.
    * ~~Automatic reset and verification of mocks.~~
    * ~~@BeforeSpecification, @AfterSpecification, @Specifications (and naming convention equivalents) can be used across base and subclasses.~~
    * ~~ Better error messages for hasBeanProperty and hasBeanPropertyWithValue. ~~
  * Expectation API
    * ~~Make expectations more like natural language. eg. isEqualTo(), doesNotEqual(), etc. Existing code using equalTo(), etc. will need to be updated.~~
    * ~~Collection checkers: hasTheSameContentAs(Collection<E>) and hasTheSameContentAs(E...). These only check content and not the order of elements.~~
    * ~~Ensure all "collection" classes (Array, Map, Set, List, String, SharSequence) have similar size checkers available.~~
    * ~~Added file checker,~~
  * JUnit integration
    * ~~ Fix Eclipse [http://code.google.com/p/instinct/issues/detail?id=20 unrooted context].~~
  * Ant integration
    * ~~Support for custom classpath.~~
    * ~~Quiet specification result formatting (only shows errors and pending specs).~~
    * ~~Use correct project logging level for errors, etc.~~
  * jMock integration
    * ~~Support states: `Mockery.states(String)`.~~
  * Infrastructure
    * ~~Removed reliance on Boost, transferred all relevant Boost classes locally.~~
    * ~~jMock 2.4.~~
    * ~~Downgraded to CGLib 2.1.3 (for Maven integration).~~
  * Bugs
    * ~~Miscellaneous NullPointerExceptions and null related problems in state expectation API.~~
    * ~~(defect-3) IterableChecker should have a containsOnly method or something.~~
    * ~~(defect-8) @BeforeSpecification does not run if implemented in an abstract base class.~~
    * ~~(defect-20) CEclipse Junit4 InstinctRunner shows tests under the "Unrooted Tests" node. ~~
    * ~~(defect-22) Context treeview shows baseclass and subclass when only subclass is run~~
    * ~~(defect-23) Overridden specifications run twice.~~

== Release 0.1.5 ==

    * ~~Add regular expression checking to string checker.~~
    * ~~Add empty checks to array checker.~~
    * ~~Expected exception (simple version, encoded in specification annotation)~~
  * JUnit Integration
    * ~~Fix concurrent modification error in JUnit 3 code.~~
    * ~~JUnit 4 runner.~~
  * QuickCheck Properties (ala Popper Theories)
    * ~~Initial prototype API~~

    * ~~Remove state-based expectation API null checks.~~
    * ~~Clean up generic warnings.~~
